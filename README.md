# MixMatched

The goal of this project is to use data from multiple music events to better equip consumers with the ability to make the best option at a price best suited to them.

MixMatched is a MERN stack web application that acts as a comparison tool for upcoming events.

It interfaces with the Spotify API for artist data and user inputted database for upcoming event information.
